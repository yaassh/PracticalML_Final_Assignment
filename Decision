# Decision
Accuracy for Random Forest model was 0.995 (95% CI: (0.993, 0.997)) compared to 0.739 (95% CI: (0.727, 0.752)) for Decision Tree model. 
The random Forest model is choosen. The accuracy of the model is 0.995. The expected out-of-sample error is estimated at 0.005, or 0.5%. 
The expected out-of-sample error is calculated as 1 - accuracy for predictions made against the cross-validation set. Our Test data set 
comprises 20 cases.
With an accuracy above 99% on our cross-validation data, we can expect that very few, or none, of the test samples will be missclassified.
